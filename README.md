# Note on use the api
Please note that when using the api endpoints with methods POST, PUT required JSON body. Security builds on
technology jackson web token (JWT) with using Bearer token.

# Instructions:
- To run the book store API on a server, you will need to first run Docker.
- After running api database in first time will create all necessary tables in database
- To register an Administrator in the system, you will need to use the endpoint "POST: /api/auth/register" just like a usual user.
  Once the Administrator user is registered, you can add a record in the table user_roles with the following query:
  "INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id) values(ID_Administrator, 2);" where "ID_Administrator" is the ID of the Administrator from the table "users". This will assign the "ADMIN" role to the newly registered user.
- All credentials for connect to database you can set in file ".env"

# User Registration : ðŸ“Œ 

1. Use the POST method:
```code
/api/auth/register
```
Example : 
```json
{
"email": "User1@example.com",
"password": "securePassword444",
"repeatPassword": "securePassword444",
"firstName": "Maria",
"lastName": "Smith",
"shippingAddress": "44 Main St, City, Country "
}
```
